# House Price Prediction

This is my **first project** during my **Machine Learning internship at PRODIGY**. The goal of this project was to implement a **Linear Regression** model to predict house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.

## Files Included

- **`House_Price_Prediction.ipynb`**: The Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the model.
- **`data_description.txt`**: A text file describing the dataset and its features.
- **`sample_submission.csv`**: A sample file for submission of predictions.
- **`test.csv`**: The test dataset for model evaluation.
- **`train.csv`**: The training dataset used to train the model.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib

3. Open the notebook House_Price_Prediction.ipynb in Jupyter and run the cells.

## Model Overview

1. Linear Regression is used to predict house prices based on the given features.
2. The model is trained on the train.csv file and evaluated using the test.csv file.
